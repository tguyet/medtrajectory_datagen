# SNDS synthetic data generator

The SNDS, formerly SNIIRAM, is a huge database (several Tb of data and about 700 tables) that contains information about healthcare reimbursements of about 60 million French insured patients.

This database is used to carry out epidemiological and medical-economic studies. Due to its sensitive medical content, identifying information (names, social security numbers) is removed or
replaced by spurious information.


This repository contains a solution to generate a synthetic version of the database. 
1) it generates relational data compliant with the original database schema, 
2) it generates data with realistic distributions, 
3) it guarantees privacy preservation thanks to the use of open data only.


This work is currently under review to the AIME conference. 
The results of some more experiments can be found in the following notebook (accessible directly within the online GitLab visualisation: [notebook](/Generator/PostGenerationAnalysis_Bretagne.ipynb) ).

# How to generate your own database

* Download all the raw data available online
  * In the `data` repository, run the script `load_opendata.py` to download and unzip open data in the repository
  * Some open data links may require user interactions to start the download, in this case, datasets have to be manually downloaded (use the links that will be provided by `load_opendata.py` script)
* Execute the Notebooks to generate intermediary files
  * Start by running the script `prepare_data.py` (ensure all the flags at the beginning of the script are set to True to generate all the required files)
  * Each step is detailed in corresponding Notebooks in the `Data_Analysis` repository
* Run the script `create_nomenclature.py` to create the nomenclature part of the SNDS. This script create a large database made of the SNDS tables that can be provided without access restriction. This part of the database is provided by the Health Data Hub.
* Move all the generated files in a repository corresponding to a simulation
* Run the `simulation35.py` script to run the simulator based on Open Data. This script can be setup (choose the population size, the number of physicians, the administrative regions to mimic, etc.)

# Open data resources 

In this section, we give the exhaustive list of the open datasets we are currently using to feed realistically our database.

* SNDS data originates from the Synthetic SNDS project [https://gitlab.com/healthdatahub/synthetic-snds]
  - SNDS Schemas have to be downloaded on the HdH [https://gitlab.com/healthdatahub/schema-snds]
    * The schemas use the `Table Schema` format
    * WARNING: I add to make small changes in the schemas to make it compatible with SQite
  - SNDS Nomenclature datasets (also available in the repos above)
    * CSV dataset containing the nomeclature used in the SNDS database
    * this information is anonymous
    
* Data coming from national statistics institute
  - population statistics, 2016: Quinquenal age, sex, city population [https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1893204#consulter]
  
* Data coming from the French Health Insurance (most of them are aggregated data from the raw SNDS itself)
  - For drugs deliveries Open Medic 2019, download: [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/91d193b4-dd34-4cda-a843-bd1eb30aa7bc]
  - For medical acts (outhospital), Open Damir 2019, download: [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/depenses-d-assurance-maladie-hors-prestations-hospitalieres-par-caisse-primaire-departement/] (used only data in January due to the size of the data)
  	- Open CCAM [https://www.scansante.fr/open-ccam/open-ccam-2016]: contains CCAM codes (not OpenDamir)
  - Information about Care Providers, Open data: [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/annuaire-sante-de-la-cnam/], download: [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/296394b6-d539-4cc7-a440-2698eec06c18]
  - Data about ALD (Long cares) 2016, Open data: [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/personnes-en-affection-de-longue-duree-ald/], downloads
    * per age/sex  [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/360e6600-7c05-46ef-aac5-cf0ea84968ae]
    * per dpt [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/26ac640b-e65f-4324-bbed-e0e9690bf449]
    * data have been reorganized manually
  - Data about care etablishment (including hospitals, pharmacies) FINESS database [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/finess-extraction-du-fichier-des-etablissements/], download: [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/16ee2cd3-b9fe-459e-8a57-46e03ba3adbd]
    * Note that the FINESS database is also available in the nomenclature
    * I used the clean version of the FINESS dataset, cleaned by a user (`finess_clean.csv`): [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/3dc9b1d5-0157-440d-a7b5-c894fcfdfd45]
  - Informations about hospitalisation (numbers of hospitalisation, CIMS codes) have been digged from [https://www.scansante.fr/] and [http://www.aideaucodage.fr/]

We invite the reader to have a look at the data preparation notebooks to have a flavour of the content of these datasets.
